            <p> This is the beginning of the space shuttle with the aim to reduce the cost of launching rockets to orbit by reusing them over and over again. It provides 135 successful shuttle launches fulfilled for many scientific and military requirements. However, the space shuttle challenger exploded twice during its lifetime, specifically in 1986 and 2003 which in total killed 14 astronauts. </p>
            <p> Space shuttle ended its mission in 2011 as it did not meet the expectation of NASA (it only added more debris in space which means it is not fully reusable and it didnâ€™t really reduce the cost). </p>
