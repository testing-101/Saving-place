            <p> Modern space exploration is reaching areas once only dreamed about. Mars is the focal point of modern space exploration, and manned Mars exploration is a long-term goal of the United States. </p>
            <p> A company named SpaceX made two of their well known fully reusable rocket named falcon 9 and falcon heavy continuing what the space shuttle has done over the decades. Both of these rockets are almost fully reusable and thought to be the most efficient rockets of all time. NASA has collaborated with SpaceX to fulfill the ambitious dream of humans colonizing Mars. It is our final destination for now, and it might continue onwards. </p>
