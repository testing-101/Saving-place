            <p> Skipping ahead to July 20, 1969, astronaut Neil Armstrong took “one giant leap for mankind” as he is the first-ever human who has stepped on the moon. During the landed missions, astronauts collected samples of rocks and lunar dust that scientists still study to learn about the moon. This marks the end of the space race which many people thought it has been won by the US. </p>
