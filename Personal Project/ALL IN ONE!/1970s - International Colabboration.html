            <p> Space stations marked the next phase of space exploration. The first space station in Earth orbit was the Soviet Salyut 1 station, which was launched in 1971. This was followed by NASA’s Skylab space station, the first orbital laboratory in which astronauts and scientists studied Earth and the effects of spaceflight on the human body. This was part of the Apollo Soyuz Test Project, the world’s first internationally crewed (American and Russian) space mission. </p>
