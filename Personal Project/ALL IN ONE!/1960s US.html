            <p> During the 1960s, NASA made progress toward President Kennedyâ€™s goal of landing a human on the moon with a program called Project Gemini which was followed by Project Apollo. It took astronauts into orbit around the moon and to the lunar surface. NASA also launched a series of space probes called Mariner, which studied Venus, Mars, and Mercury. Furthermore, they also launched Voyager which took detailed images of Jupiter and Saturn, their rings, and their moons.</p>
