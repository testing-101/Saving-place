            <p> This is the beginning of a new era. The first piece of the International Space Station was launched in November 1998. More pieces were added over the next two years before the station was ready for people to live there. NASA is using the space station to learn more about living and working in space. These lessons will make it possible to send humans farther into space than ever before. </p>
